I have done this project as a part of the UDACITY Big Data course.
In this course the major foucs was to learn to Write Map reduce code and run through a linux environment. I also learned to setup a hadoop cluster on Amazon EC2 Instances and using cloudera quick start vm .

In this project I wrote various MapREduce codes using python to retrive information from 2 large dataset. The 1st dataset was of Sales data from various stores accross the country. The second data was website log data.

During the course I used my codes to answer many relevant questions such as that of maximum hits, Highest sales, most popular website, etc.

Please find the complete dataset on udacity.com

Hope this helps
